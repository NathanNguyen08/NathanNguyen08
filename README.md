## Hi there, I'm Nathan! 

I am currently a third-year student studying computer science at the University of California, Irvine!

I am interested in machine learning and eager to learn more about it during my time at UCI. I aspire to either pursue research in the field or work in the software development industry. In my spare time, I love playing video games, catching up on anime, and working out at the ARC. 

If you have any questions or would like to chat, feel free to reach out to me by [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-p-nguyen/) or through email at nathan.nguyen0815@gmail.com!
